What is collective.eggproxy ?
=============================

collective.eggproxy is a smart mirror for PyPI.

It will collect packages on PyPI only when a program like easy_install
or zc.buildout asks for it. In other words, unlike some mirrors
that act like rsync and get the whole PyPI base (more than 5 gigas)
collective.eggproxy will only get what you need.

At first run collective.eggproxy downloads pypi index and builds a page of links. 
When a software asks for a specific package, version, etc. 
collective.eggproxy downloads it if needed and store it locally.

How to use collective.eggproxy ?
================================

After it has been installed, you can just launch it as a standalone server 
like this::

    $ mkdir /tmp/eggs
    $ eggproxy_run 

The proxy will then ben available on the localhost on the port 8888.
All package will be downloaded by default into /var/www. If this directory
does not exists (or if you are under windows), you will need to configure it,
as explained in the next section.

From there you can use it in easy_install like this::

    easy_install -i http://localhost:8888/ -H "*localhost*" iw.fss

The iw.fss package will be downloaded, stored locally and provided to easy_insall.

In zc.buildout, just define the index value in the buildout section::

    [buildout]

    index = http://localhost:8888/
    allow-hosts = *localhost*

That's it !
 
Advanced configuration
======================

collective.eggproxy can use a configuration file:

Currently its location is fixed at /etc/eggproxy.conf and looks like this::

    [default]
    eggs_directory = /path/to/pypi
    index = http://pypi.python.org/simple

    # update information for files older than 24h
    update_interval = 24

If `/etc/eggproxy.conf` is not found, it will look into your home folder, so 
you can alternatively put this configuration file in your home directory,
which can be convenient under Windows.

Running the proxy using Paste
=============================

You need a paste configuration file like this::

  [server:main]
  use = egg:Paste#http
  port = 8888

  [app:main]
  use = egg:collective.eggproxy
  eggs_directory = /usr/share/eggs_directory
  index = http://pypi.python.org/simple

This configuration will override the `eggproxy.conf` file.

Then use `paster` as usual::  

  $ paster serve configfile.ini

And test it::  

  $ easy_install -i http://localhost:8888/ -H "*localhost*" iw.fss

Using the proxy behind Apache
=============================

You can also use collective.eggproxy with Apache. You will need for that 
mod_python 3.3 for apache. It will not work with previous versions.

Debian Etch users: Etch provides 3.2, so users of Etch must get the source
package from "Lenny" (testing) and rebuild it with dpkg-buildpackage. Please have
a look at the related section in this document to get some help.

An Apache setup for http://servername/pypi can be::

    Alias /pypi "/path/to/pypi"
    <Directory "/path/to/pypi">
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        SetHandler mod_python
        PythonFixupHandler collective.eggproxy.apache_handler::fixup_handler
        PythonInterpreter main_interpreter
        PythonOption URLPrefix /pypi
        PythonPath "sys.path+['/path/to/collective.eggproxy']"
    </Directory>

Apache must be able to write to "/path/to/pypi"! (usually Apache user is
`www-data`). For updating proxied egg information you must add the script
`eggproxy_update` into the crontab of this user.

Quick build instructions from debian "lenny" sources::

    $ sudo apt-get build-dep libapache2-mod-python
    $ sudo apt-get install fakeroot

Visit http://packages.debian.org/sources/lenny/libapache2-mod-python and grab 
the files with these extensions:

- .dsc
- .orig.tar.gz
- .diff.gz

::

    $ wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/liba/libapache2-mod-python/libapache2-mod-python_3.3.1-3.dsc
    $ wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/liba/libapache2-mod-python/libapache2-mod-python_3.3.1.orig.tar.gz
    $ wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/liba/libapache2-mod-python/libapache2-mod-python_3.3.1-3.diff.gz
    $ tar xpvzf libapache2-mod-python_3.3.1.orig.tar.gz
    $ cd mod_python-3.3.1/
    $ gzip -dc ../libapache2-mod-python_3.3.1-3.diff.gz |patch -p1
    $ chmod +x debian/rules
    $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b
    $ cd ..

you should have the following files: 

- libapache2-mod-python_3.3.1-3_i386.deb 
- libapache2-mod-python-doc_3.3.1-3_all.deb

The last step is calling `dpkg`::

    $ sudo dpkg -i libapache2-mod-python_3.3.1-3_i386.deb
